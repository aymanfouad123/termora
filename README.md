Termora is a privacy-first, local-first AI agent that lives in your terminal. It understands natural language and translates your requests into safe, explainable shell commands.

Termora is:

- üß† **Context-aware** (files, OS, shell history)
- üõ°Ô∏è **Safe** (dry-run previews, rollback support, backups)
- üîÅ **Agentic** (can reason over multi-step workflows)
- üí¨ **Conversational** (you don't have to write in "command speak")

## Examples

Say things like:

```bash
termora chat
> organize my downloads folder and group files by type
> create a daily backup routine to Dropbox
> mute my Mac when I join Zoom
> summarize today's git changes
```

Termora figures out what to do, explains it, and asks you for confirmation. It logs everything locally.

## Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Just describe what you want done
- **Context-Aware Reasoning**: Understands your files, OS, and recent commands
- **Safe Execution**: Preview commands before they run
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates backups before destructive operations
- **Rollback Support**: `termora rollback last` to undo operations
- **Multi-model Support**: Works with OpenAI, Groq, Claude, or local Ollama models
- **Cross-platform**: Supports macOS and Linux

## Installation

# Not yet available via pip - coming soon!

It's not just a shell tool ‚Äî it's your agentic terminal copilot.

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security
